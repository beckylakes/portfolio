        <h1>About Me.</h1>
        <p>
          As a long-time tech enthusiast & advocate for a more diverse tech-space, I 
          have been amazed by coding & what can be accomplished with it.
          Since becoming an IT recruiter and speaking to some amazing talents,
          I realised that instead of admiring what software engineers do, I wanted to
          get involved myself and be a part of the amazing world of tech. In January 2024,
          I began my  13-week journey to becoming a software developer at the
          Northcodersâ€™ coding bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the bootcamp, not only did I meet some amazing tutors and fellow students,
          I also gained invaluable hands-on experience in web and mobile development, learnt key computer science concepts, and applied industry best practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD). I also had the chance to present alongside my team a progressive web-app that we created from scratch whilst applying what we'd learnt during Northcoders projects to an entirely new tech-stack - a tricky yet extremely fun experience{" "}

          >
            (You can see more here!)
          </a>{" "}
          My overall experience has further inspired me to learn more
          about technology and its role in society.
